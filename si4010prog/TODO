generic
-------
- Better handling of running/debug state, to prevent the bus to become broken when issuing a wrong combination of commands.
- test function that checks if bus works and requests/checks the device product ID's
- Direct load NBF files
- write man page
- quiet, and binary output options for easy dumping of memory to binary file
- Allow formatted output with c2_bus_set_error()
- Implement: lram, lxram

breakpoints
-----------
- Detect breakpoint triggering
- Wait for breakpoint

bus
---
- Update C2_GPIO to be more like a modern kernel module, like:
  - Use device tree
  - Register device file so it is automatically created
- Fix LPT based bus master(c2drv) to work with modern kernel (no prio, since LPT is kinda dead)

ft232
-----
- Find out why 'halt' doesn't work after loading code
- Error reporting should include libftdi error message (extend c2_bus_set_error() first)
