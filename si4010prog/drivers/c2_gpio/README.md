# Linux GPIO  C2 Bus Master Implementation
This Linux kernel module implements a C2 Bus Master by bit banging on two GPIO
pins. The driver is based on the 'c2drv' code from Wojciech M. Zabolotny.

By default the following pin assignment is used:

 * C2 Clock = GPIO 17
 * C2 Data  = GPIO 18

The pin assignment can be changed with the 'gpio_c2ck' and 'gpio_c2d'
parameters.

# Usage
*WARNING*: Before loading the c2_gpio module check that you didn't forget to
add 1K resistors in the C2 data and clock lines

To use the driver first load the module into the kernel using insmod or
modprobe. After loading you have manually to create a device file. This can be
done with the following commands:

   insmod c2_gpio.ko
   mknod /dev/c2_bus c 243 0
   chmod 777 /dev/c2_bus

Finally you have to tell si4010prog to use the c2_gpio bus master by adding the
'-d' option. For instance:

   ./si4010prog -d c2drv:///dev/c2_bus reset identify

# Code Maturity
Currently the code is just a quick hack of the c2drv to use GPIO instead of the
LPT port. It contains alot of cruft.

I only tested it with Linux kernel 4.1.20 on a Raspberry PI. In theory it
should run on any platform supporting GPIO. But in practice you might run into
timing issues.

The driver currently does not support the interrupts generated by the MCU, as
used for breakpoint signaling. But at the time of writing si4010prog also
doesn't support this.
