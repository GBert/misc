#
# asx8051 is the assembler provided with the SDCC tools. The options provided to the assembler are:
# Option 	Purpose
#  l 	generates a list file
#  o 	generates an object file
#  ff 	flag reallocatable references by mode in listing file
#  g 	make undefined symbols be global
#  p 	disables listing pagination
#
# The "o" option is mandatory, as the linker requires list, object and symbol files to generate executables. The "ff" and "p" options generate a readable list file. The "g" option tells the assembler to not generate an error if it finds an undefined symbol that is not declared as external.
