  1. correctly parse and handle optional args in easy-loader.
     Eg. allow -e and -f simultaneously.

  2. need to fix timeout so it is smaller but also retry commands.

  3. add optional bootloader entry pin. when enabled the bootloader
     is only ever entered when the pin is active. this is to shorten
     start up delay and also easily allow upgrading remote devices
     on a CAN bus.

666. find other things to put in this TODO list.
