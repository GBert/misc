 * -usbmmap.c-
 * USB Memory Map
 * This file is the USB memory manager; it serves as a compile-time memory
 * allocator for the USB endpoints. It uses the compile time options passed
 * from usbcfg.h to instantiate endpoints and endpoint buffer.
 *
 * Each endpoint requires to have a set of Buffer Descriptor registers(BDT).
 * A BDT is 4-byte long and has a specific RAM location for each endpoint.
 * The BDT for endpoint 0 out is located at address 0x400 to 0x403.
 * The BDT for endpoint 0 in is located at address 0x404 to 0x407.
 * The BDT for endpoint 1 out is located at address 0x408 to 0x40B.
 * and so on... The above allocation assumes the Ping-Pong Buffer Mode 0 is
 * used. These locations are already hard-wired in the silicon. The point
 * of doing instantiation, i.e. volatile far BDT ep0Bo;, is to provide the
 * C compiler a way to address each variable directly. This is very important
 * because when a register can be accessed directly, it saves execution time
 * and reduces program size.
 * 
 * Endpoints are defined using the endpoint number and the direction
 * of transfer. For simplicity, usbmmap.c only uses the endpoint number
 * in the BDT register allocation scheme. This means if the usbcfg.h states
 * that the MAX_EP_NUMBER is number 1, then four BDTs will be
 * instantiated: one each for endpoint0 in and endpoint0 out, which must
 * always be instantiated for control transfer by default, and one each sets
 * for endpoint1 in and endpoint1 out. The naming convention for instantiating
 * BDT is
 * 
 * ep<#>B<d>
 *
 * where # is the endpoint number, and d is the direction of
 * transfer, which could be either <i> or <o>.
 *
 * The USB memory manager uses MAX_EP_NUMBER, as defined in usbcfg.h, to define
 * the endpoints to be instantiated. This represents the highest endpoint
 * number to be allocated, not how many endpoints are used. Since the BDTs for
 * endpoints have hardware-assigned addresses in Bank 4, setting this value too
 * high may lead to inefficient use of data RAM. For example, if an application
 * uses only endpoints EP0 and EP4, then the MAX_EP_NUMBER is 4, and not 2.
 * The in-between endpoint BDTs in this example (EP1, EP2, and EP3) go unused,
 * and the 24 bytes of memory associated with them are wasted. It does not make
 * much sense to skip endpoints, but the final decision lies with the user.
 *
 * The next step is to assign the instantiated BDTs to different
 * USB functions. The firmware framework fundamentally assumes that every USB
 * function should know which endpoint it is using, i.e., the default control
 * transfer should know that it is using endpoint 0 in and endpoint 0 out.
 * A HID class can choose which endpoint it wants to use, but once chosen, it
 * should always know the number of the endpoint.
 *
 * The assignment of endpoints to USB functions is managed centrally
 * in usbcfg.h. This helps prevent the mistake of having more
 * than one USB function using the same endpoint. The "Endpoint Allocation"
 * section in usbcfg.h provides examples for how to map USB endpoints to USB
 * functions.
 * Quite a few things can be mapped in that section. There is no
 * one correct way to do the mapping and the user has the choice to
 * choose a method that is most suitable to the application.
 *
 * Typically, however, a user will want to map the following for a given
 * USB interface function:
 * 1. The USB interface ID
 * 2. The endpoint control registers (UEPn)
 * 3. The BDT registers (ep<#>B<d>)
 * 4. The endpoint size
 *
 * Example: Assume a USB device class "foo", which uses one out endpoint
 *          of size 64-byte and one in endpoint of size 64-byte, then:
 *
 * #define FOO_INTF_ID          0x00
 * #define FOO_UEP              UEP1
 * #define FOO_BD_OUT           ep1Bo
 * #define FOO_BD_IN            ep1Bi
 * #define FOO_EP_SIZE          64
 *
 * The mapping above has chosen class "foo" to use endpoint 1.
 * The names are arbitrary and can be anything other than FOO_??????.
 * For abstraction, the code for class "foo" should use the abstract
 * definitions of FOO_BD_OUT,FOO_BD_IN, and not ep1Bo or ep1Bi.
 *
 * Note that the endpoint size defined in the usbcfg.h file is again
 * used in the usbmmap.c file. This shows that the relationship between
 * the two files are tightly related.
 * 
 * The endpoint buffer for each USB function must be located in the
 * dual-port RAM area and has to come after all the BDTs have been
 * instantiated. An example declaration is:
 * volatile far unsigned char[FOO_EP_SIZE] data;
 *
 * The 'volatile' keyword tells the compiler not to perform any code
 * optimization on this variable because its content could be modified
 * by the hardware. The 'far' keyword tells the compiler that this variable
 * is not located in the Access RAM area (0x000 - 0x05F).
 *
 * For the variable to be globally accessible by other files, it should be
 * declared in the header file usbmmap.h as an extern definition, such as
 * extern volatile far unsigned char[FOO_EP_SIZE] data;
 *
 * Conclusion:
 * In a short summary, the dependencies between usbcfg and usbmmap can
 * be shown as:
 *
 * usbcfg[MAX_EP_NUMBER] -> usbmmap
 * usbmmap[ep<#>B<d>] -> usbcfg
 * usbcfg[EP size] -> usbmmap
 * usbcfg[abstract ep definitions] -> usb9/hid/cdc/etc class code
 * usbmmap[endpoint buffer variable] -> usb9/hid/cdc/etc class code
 *
 * Data mapping provides a means for direct addressing of BDT and endpoint
 * buffer. This means less usage of pointers, which equates to a faster and
 * smaller program code.
