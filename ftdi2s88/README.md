S88 Interface using FTDI in SYNC-BITBANG mode
=============================================

Why ?:

It's easy to use GPIOs connecting S88-Bus (http://s88udp.de/).
But some boards don't have accessible GPIOs.

With FTDI's synch bitbanging capable USB to serial converters you
can build lightweight S88 interfaces. It's only copying buffers
so it dosn't need much CPU cycles.

The programm sends M\*rklin S88 events on UDP port 15731 (broadcast).
The datagrams are encapsulated CAN-Frames.
