# I/O 1/2-bit delay/sleep time
#
# For ttyS 1 is fine
# For ttyUSB try 600
#
# When SLEEP is set to zero no delay is taken
# When SLEEP is less than 10, then SLEEP x I/O bit time is taken for R-PI and tty
# When SLEEP is less than 100 a busy loop is utilised
# When SLEEP is >=100 then system usleep is used.
